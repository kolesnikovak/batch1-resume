# Interview Talking Points

## Tell Me About Yourself - Short & Casual (30-45 seconds)

Hi Team! I'm Kate! I've been in QA Automation for 7 years. I specialized in UI, API, performance, and mobile testing—all integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

Also I've had expirience with building from scratch and optimizing an automation frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium. 

Outside of work, I play ukrainian musical instrument bandura, and love to go for outdoor walks.

## Tell Me About Yourself - Formal & Detailed (60-90 seconds)

I'm a Senior QA Automation Engineer with over 7 years of experience building enterprise-scale test automation frameworks for regulated industries like finance and healthcare. Currently at PepsiCo, I architect and maintain test automation across 12 microservices using modern tools like Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium.

My expertise spans the full testing stack—UI, API, performance, and mobile testing—all integrated into CI/CD pipelines. I'm particularly strong in TypeScript, Python, and Java, and I've worked extensively with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

What I'm most proud of is my track record of measurable impact: I've reduced defect escape rates by over 60%, improved test execution speeds by 65%, and reduced test flakiness from 12% down to less than 2%. I also mentor junior engineers and drive shift-left testing practices across teams.

I'm passionate about quality engineering and continuous improvement, and I'm excited about opportunities to bring my skills in automation, cloud-native architectures, and DevOps practices to new challenges.

## Tell Me About Your Current Project at PepsiCo

**Context:**
I'm currently working on a microservices-based e-commerce platform at PepsiCo with 12 interconnected services handling high-volume transactions.

**My Role & Challenges:**
I architected the entire test automation strategy from the ground up. The main challenges were:
- Migrating from a legacy Selenium Grid setup to a modern, faster framework
- Testing complex API contracts between microservices
- Ensuring reliability at scale with minimal flakiness

**Technical Approach:**
- Built a hybrid framework using **Playwright and TypeScript** for modern services, while maintaining **Selenium** for legacy components—this reduced execution time by 65%
- Implemented **contract testing with Pact** to catch integration issues early between microservices
- Used **Wiremock** to mock external dependencies, enabling isolated, reliable tests
- Set up **performance testing with Locust** to validate the system handles 8,000 requests per second during peak loads

**Infrastructure:**
- Deployed everything on **AWS using Docker containers on ECS**
- Integrated with **Kafka** for test event streaming and **CloudWatch/New Relic** for observability
- Built a **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** that runs tests on every PR, nightly, and before releases

**Impact:**
- Achieved 85% automated test coverage across all services
- Reduced test flakiness from 12% to under 2%
- Improved system throughput by 40% by identifying bottlenecks through performance testing
- Enabled 15+ daily deployments with confidence

**Team Collaboration:**
I also mentor 3 junior engineers, collaborate with DevOps on infrastructure, and work closely with developers to implement shift-left practices—catching bugs earlier in the development cycle.

## Tell Me About Your Fidelity Project (Backup if Asked About Previous Role)

**Context:**
At Fidelity Investments, I worked on a FinTech platform in a highly regulated environment where compliance and audit traceability were critical.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Built an enterprise **Playwright framework using Java and TypeScript** with **Cucumber BDD** for stakeholder collaboration
- Implemented **contract testing with Pact** to validate microservices interactions
- Conducted **performance testing with Gatling and REST Assured**, validating the system could handle 15,000 concurrent users
- Tested **mobile apps with Appium**, including biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID)

**Cloud & CI/CD:**
- Deployed test infrastructure on **AWS Lambda and Kubernetes (EKS)**
- Integrated with **Azure DevOps pipelines** for automated testing on every commit and release

**Compliance:**
- Ensured **SOX compliance** with full audit traceability—linking every test case to user stories and PRs
- Used **Azure Test Plans and JIRA** for comprehensive test management

**Impact:**
- Achieved 95% automation coverage
- Reduced defect escape rate from 8% to 2%
- Enabled faster, more reliable releases in a regulated finance environment

## Key Talking Points Summary

### Strengths to Emphasize:
✅ **Modern Tools:** Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Postman, REST Assured  
✅ **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Java—versatile and polyglot  
✅ **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (ECS, Lambda, EKS), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins)  
✅ **Testing Expertise:** UI, API, performance (Locust, Gatling), mobile (Appium), contract testing (Pact)  
✅ **Regulated Industries:** Finance (Fidelity) and Healthcare (Roche)—understand compliance and audit requirements  
✅ **Leadership:** Mentoring, shift-left advocacy, cross-team collaboration  
✅ **Measurable Impact:** 65% faster tests, 60% defect reduction, 2% flakiness

### Questions to Prepare For:
1. "How do you handle flaky tests?"
2. "Describe a time you improved test coverage or speed."
3. "How do you decide what to automate vs. test manually?"
4. "How do you ensure quality in CI/CD pipelines?"
5. "Tell me about a challenging bug you found."

## STAR Method Examples (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

### Example 1: Reducing Test Flakiness

**Situation:** At PepsiCo, our test suite had 12% flakiness, causing false failures and slowing down releases.

**Task:** I was tasked with identifying root causes and stabilizing the test suite.

**Action:**
- Analyzed failure patterns and identified timing issues and environment inconsistencies
- Implemented auto-wait mechanisms in Playwright
- Standardized test data setup and teardown
- Moved tests to Docker containers for consistent environments
- Added retry logic only for known infrastructure issues

**Result:** Reduced flakiness from 12% to under 2%, restoring team confidence in the test suite.

---

### Example 2: Migrating from Selenium to Playwright

**Situation:** Legacy Selenium tests were slow (45 minutes for full regression) and brittle.

**Task:** Modernize the framework without disrupting ongoing development.

**Action:**
- Conducted a POC with Playwright and demonstrated 60%+ speed improvements
- Created a migration plan to run both frameworks in parallel
- Trained the team on Playwright best practices
- Gradually migrated critical paths first, then the full suite

**Result:** Reduced execution time by 65% (45 min → 16 min), improved reliability, and enabled faster feedback for developers.

---

### Example 3: Implementing Contract Testing

**Situation:** At PepsiCo, microservices integration bugs were slipping into production.

**Task:** Find a way to catch integration issues earlier before full end-to-end testing.

**Action:**
- Introduced **Pact for contract testing** between services
- Worked with developers to define contracts and integrate Pact into their CI/CD pipelines
- Set up a Pact Broker to share and verify contracts across teams

**Result:** Caught 15+ integration bugs in the first month, reduced end-to-end test dependencies, and improved team autonomy.
