## About Tailscale

Tailscale is building the new Internet by delivering software that makes it easy to securely interconnect people and their devices, no matter where they are. From hobbyists to multinational corporations, teams of every size use Tailscale each day to protect their networks, share access to internal tools, and more. We're building a future for the Internet that's easy, sensible, and safe, like it used to be. Founded in 2019 and fully distributed, we're backed by Accel, CRV, Insight, Heavybit, and Uncork Capital.

## Job Description

We're seeking a talented and motivated full-time Test Automation Engineer to join our growing team. You will work as part of the engineering team to:

- Design, build, and maintain robust automated testing frameworks for our apps across Windows, macOS, iOS, tvOS, Android, and Linux platforms, ensuring scalable and maintainable test architecture.
- Ensure automated test plan coverage for our growing feature set, working closely with product and engineering to understand new and existing features.

Because we're an early-stage and fully remote company, we're looking for a motivated individual who can help move the product forward. The ability to think on your feet, collaborate with highly technical teams, and comfort working asynchronously are essential.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design, implement, and maintain automated test frameworks for our applications across multiple platforms.
- Integrate automated test suites into continuous integration pipelines to ensure consistent and reliable testing.
- Identify high priority or error prone functionality to automate.
- Collaborate with product and engineering teams to understand new features and ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- Develop and execute test plans, test cases, and test scripts to validate application functionality.
- Analyze test results and work with the development team to resolve issues.

## What We Are Looking For

- 5+ years of experience in software testing, with a focus on test automation.
- Experience with mobile and desktop application testing across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux).
- Familiarity with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes and tools.
- Knowledge of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Go for writing test scripts and automation.
- Strong understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, routing protocols, firewalls, and VPN technologies with ability to analyze network traffic and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills with experience creating detailed test documentation, bug reports, and technical specifications for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a keen attention to detail.

## Nice to Have

- Experience with network protocols, VPN technologies, and security testing.
- Familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes, or container-based testing environments.
- Knowledge of network simulation tools and techniques for testing networked applications.
- Experience managing physical device labs, including mobile and desktop devices, for testing purposes.

## US Pay Ranges

$143,000—$204,000 USD

As a company, we strive to maintain fair and equitable compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels. Tailscale's compensation package includes base salary, equity, and comprehensive benefits. The salary range displayed on each job posting represents the target range for a new hire's base salary. Individual offers may vary based on experience and skill set.

*Frequently cited statistics show that people who identify with historically marginalized groups are likely to apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. **We encourage you to help us break that statistic!***

## What We Offer

- An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
- A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
- Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!
- Remote first company—most of our teams work fully remotely. Enjoy a change of scenery wherever you can get wifi, participate in virtual and in-person social events, and leverage our corporate co-working program to visit WeWork (or other similar spaces near you). Some roles require in-office collaboration depending on team needs, which will be clearly noted in the job description.
- Connect with other Tailscalars IRL. Attend our annual company retreat, participate in team/department off-sites, or use your individual travel budget to meet up with team members in Canada, the US, or the UK.
- Support for your personal and professional development. Grow your career thoughtfully with $1500 USD annually for professional development, or take advantage of mentorship, coaching, and internal promotion opportunities.
- Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world!
- A build-your-own home office setup. You choose your own company-owned laptop (Mac or PC), receive a monthly home internet reimbursement, and $1000 USD to customize your workstation to make it your own.
- Generous parental leave program from your first day. We care about your life outside of work and encourage new parents to take advantage of parental leave top-ups for up to 26 weeks.
