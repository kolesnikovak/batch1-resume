# Interview Speech - Tailored to Job Requirements (SHORT VERSION)

## Opening - Tell Me About Yourself (45 seconds)

Hi, I'm Kate. I'm a Senior QA Automation Engineer with 7 years of experience in both automation and manual testing. I've worked in finance at Fidelity and healthcare at Roche—both heavily regulated industries.

I specialize in UI automation with Playwright and Selenium, API testing with Postman and REST Assured, and mobile testing with Appium. I'm strong in Java, TypeScript, and Python, and I've built multiple automation frameworks from scratch.

Currently at PepsiCo, I'm managing test automation across 12 microservices with 85% coverage. I'm passionate about quality engineering and love working in collaborative Agile teams.

## Quick Answers to Key Requirements

### 1️⃣ "5+ years QA experience (automation + manual)"

"I have 7 years of experience. I started at Roche doing manual exploratory testing and building automation frameworks. At Fidelity and PepsiCo, I focused more on automation but still do manual testing for UX validation and edge cases."

---

### 2️⃣ "Java, test automation frameworks, mobile testing"

"I built an enterprise automation framework at Fidelity using **Java, Maven, and TestNG** with the Page Object Model. I've also worked with **Selenium**, **Playwright**, **Cypress**, and **Cucumber BDD**.

For mobile testing, I use **Appium** for iOS and Android—testing on emulators and real devices. I've validated features like biometric authentication and deep linking."

---

### 3️⃣ "API testing (Postman, REST Assured), backend data flows"

"I use **Postman** for manual API testing and **REST Assured with Java** for automation. I validate endpoints, response codes, JSON schemas, and integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines.

I also use **Pact for contract testing** between microservices and understand backend data flows through APIs, databases, and message queues like **Kafka**."

---

### 4️⃣ "SQL and data validation across pipelines"

"I'm proficient in SQL and work with **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **DynamoDB**. I validate CRUD operations, data transformations, and referential integrity.

For data pipelines, I validate data at each stage—extraction, transformation, and load—ensuring accuracy across systems. At Fidelity, I validated financial transactions with SQL queries for SOX compliance."

---

### 5️⃣ "Azure Data Factory, Databricks, ETL validation"

"I haven't used Azure Data Factory or Databricks directly, but I have strong ETL and data validation experience. At PepsiCo, I validated data flows through microservices using **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **RDS**.

I understand data pipeline testing, schema validation, and data quality checks. I'm confident I can quickly learn ADF and Databricks since the core ETL concepts are the same."

---

### 6️⃣ "Agile/Scrum experience"

"I've worked exclusively in Agile environments. I actively participate in all Scrum ceremonies—Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives.

I practice shift-left testing, collaborating with developers early to define acceptance criteria and improve testability. At Fidelity, I worked across 3 Agile teams coordinating testing strategies."

---

### 7️⃣ "Problem-solving, communication, documentation"

**Problem-Solving:**
"At PepsiCo, I reduced test flakiness from 12% to under 2% by analyzing patterns and implementing Docker containers and auto-wait mechanisms. I also introduced Pact for contract testing, catching 15+ bugs in the first month."

**Communication:**
"I work closely with developers, product managers, and DevOps. I write clear bug reports and mentor junior engineers. At Fidelity, I implemented Cucumber BDD to improve collaboration with non-technical stakeholders."

**Documentation:**
"I document test plans, frameworks, and CI/CD setups. At PepsiCo, I created comprehensive guides for our Playwright framework. I also link test cases to JIRA for full traceability."
